# Title: [bDIP-N: Updating the Mandate of Governance Department]

**Draft Authors**: [Baer.eth]

**Working Group**: [DAOstewards.eth - BanklessDAO Workstream]

BDIP SUMMARY

# TLDR;

This bDIP aims to reflect the current status of the Constitution updation process on Github and give the Newly formed Governance Department the mandate to update the Constitution and Community Handbook source in version control.

# BDIP BACKGROUND

The constitution mandated the OpsGuild - further referred to as Ops Department - to update and version control the Constitution and Community Handbook source as new bDIPs have passed by the community.
The Ops Department cannot fulfil the mandate for the following reasons.   
* The scope of the Ops department's mission is limited to Watching over the daily activities of the DAO.
* there needs to be more appetite for governance-related tasks at Ops other than Season planning

Governance Department is a newly formed, nonfunded department to facilitate governance processes and provide GovOPs and GovStratagy to the DAO.
Previously passed bDIPs were incorporated by Icedcoolüè¥#4947 and Baer.eth#6344, both members of the governance Dept.
Updating the constitution by mandating the version control of the constitution from end to end will enable the Governance department to exercise its formation purpose.
Since the introduction of the Constitution, BanklessDAO has passed three bDIPs (bDIP-00,bDIP-01,bDIP-2).



# BDIP SPECIFICATION

Explain the textual change to the community handbook in detail.
    

| Current Form | Proposal |
| -------- | -------- |
| If the passing proposal is a bDIP, OpsGuild will be prompted to update the Constitution, and Community Handbook source in version control and a new version of the Handbook will be made available to the community.	| If the passing proposal is a bDIP, *Governance Department* will be prompted to update the Constitution and Community Handbook source in version control, and a new version of the Handbook will be made available to the community. |

As mentioned in the bDIP background, the Governance department is probably the aptest entity to regularly update the version of the BanklessDAO constitution in all available forms.

This bDIP can be considered ‚Äòminor‚Äô since it corrects discrepancies in the mandate of an Ops Department.

# EXPECTED IMPACT
If this proposal is implemented, the governance department can house all governance-related activities within BanklessDAO under Governance Department.

# ANALYTICS

The impact can be measured by
* The number of bDIPs incorporated into the constitution by the governance department.
* accuracy of the BanklessDAO Constitution and Community Handbook source

1. Approval of this bDIP with 51 votes.
2. Assign bDIP a number once this proposal enters the Snapshot vote.
